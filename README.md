[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sethwalker1/pizza-project.svg?token=QwzyWZdv7HDK4kqmD2uU&branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/sethwalker1/pizza-project)

## Installation.
Warning: Installing Ruby + Jekyll can be a painstaking process on windows, and it is **highly** recommended to use the [live demo](https://pizza-project.sethw.me/) instead.

Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

##### Within the root of the project, follow these steps:
Install bundler modules
```bash
cd www
bundle install
```

Installation complete! Now you should be able to run the project (from the `www` directory)
`bundle exec jekyll serve`
